    <h1>Germany</h1>

    <h2>short history</h2>
    
    <h3>1945-1958</h3>
    <p class="paragraph">
        After its defeat in WWII  Germany was split between its west and east sides.
        The west side became the  Federalist Republic of Germany, 
        while the east side became the German Democratic Republic.
        The East side was led by the Socialist Unity Party of Germany.
        East Germany stagnated as it became designed to only meet the needs of 
        the soviet union.
        Meanwhile West Germany became the most prosperous economy in Europe.

    <h3> Germany in The 21st Century</h3>

    <p class="paragraph">
        Germany is accredited for leading the european union as the dominant european power. 
        Additionally its friendly amnesty laws make it ideal for immigrants, Germany 
        holds the second greatest population of immigrants. 
        Itâ€™s future as its past still largely depends on how well it 
        integrates with the global economy and its internal population.
